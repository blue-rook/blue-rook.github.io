## Who we are

Blue Rook Technology is a small, independent data consultancy. We are engineers first — people who enjoy solving hard problems with simple, well-crafted solutions. No layers of management, no bloated proposals, no enterprise theater. Just experienced practitioners who care deeply about the work.

We chose the name "Blue Rook" because the rook is the most straightforward piece on the chessboard: it moves in clean, direct lines and becomes more powerful as the board clears. That is how we like to operate — cut through the noise, deliver value, move on.

## What we do

We help organizations get their data infrastructure right. That means different things for different teams:

- **Data pipeline engineering** — designing and building reliable pipelines that move data from source systems to analytical platforms without surprises at 3 AM.
- **Data quality and observability** — implementing validation, monitoring, and alerting so you know when something goes wrong *before* your stakeholders do.
- **Platform modernization** — migrating legacy ETL workflows to modern stacks (Python, SQL, cloud-native tooling) without disrupting ongoing operations.
- **Technical strategy** — advising on architecture decisions, tool selection, and build-vs-buy trade-offs with hands-on experience backing every recommendation.

## How we work

We keep things lean. Our engagements are scoped tightly, our communication is direct, and we ship working code early. We believe that a small team of motivated engineers consistently outperforms larger groups weighed down by coordination overhead.

Every project starts with understanding the problem — not selling a solution. We ask hard questions, prototype fast, and iterate based on real feedback. If a problem is simpler than it looks, we will tell you. If it is harder, we will tell you that too.

## Our stack

We are pragmatists, not dogmatists. That said, we have strong opinions built from experience:

- **Python** and **SQL** as our primary languages — they go everywhere data goes.
- **Polars** for in-memory data processing when performance matters.
- **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite** for storage that just works.
- **Git** and **CI/CD** as non-negotiable foundations for any data project.
- Cloud platforms as needed — but we don't lock you into one vendor.

## Open source

We build tools for the community. Our projects reflect the same philosophy we bring to client work: solve a real problem, keep it simple, test it thoroughly. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/pedrogasparotti) to see what we are working on.
